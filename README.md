# Create CIP App

Hello! This is my script to create apps using my usual structure and stack, it's a little annoying to setup by hand every time, so I made this script to automate the process.
Hope it is useful for you too!

Stack:

-   Framework: SvelteKit
-   UI: TailwindCSS
-   State Management: Svelte Store
-   Backend: Rust with Actix Web
-   Database: Postgres
-   Monorepo: NX
-   And finally cypress for e2e testing

## Getting Started

You can install this script globally with `npm i -g create-cip-app` or run it with `npx create-cip-app` and follow the instructions.

## Contributing
