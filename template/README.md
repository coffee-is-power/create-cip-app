# This project was generated by create-cip-app

This project uses [nx](https://nx.dev) to manage the monorepo, see apps folder to find the backend and frontend of your app.

Create packages in the libs folder to share code between apps and create your component libraries for your design. See the [nx documentation](https://nx.dev) for more information.

If you want to remote cache the builds for better performance across your team and CI, head over to nx cloud and create an account, then run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to create a workspace and link it with your project, also don't worry, the access token can and should be commited to the repo.
